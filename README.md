RudeCMS is a super-simple content management system (CMS). I wanted a simple, flat-file site that could display a photo and some text underneath. Nothing too fancy, but unlike Goldilocks, I couldn't find one that was "just right". So I built my own. Check out my artwork of birds being rude at https://rudebirdies.com to see RudeCMS in action. It also functions as a live beta-test where I test out changes before bringing them into this repo.

Completely flat-file, no databases to corrupt or slow you down. Let me know if you use it and I'll link to your site!

**Future Updates**
- A better admin interface
- A more secure admin area (use htaccess / htpasswd for now)
- Anything else I think is cool

**Installation**
- Unzip the release into a folder onto your server and you're good to go. 
- Rename the "Admin" folder and add some .htaccess / .htpasswd security on the folder because there's no security built into it yet.

**Customization**
- Update the settings.php file with your site details, social links, preferred colours etc.
- Swap out the logo file
- Swap out the favicon.ico
