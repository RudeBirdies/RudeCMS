RudeCMS is a super-simple content management system (CMS). I wanted a simple, flat-file site that could display a photo and some text underneath. Nothing too fancy, but unlike Goldilocks, I couldn't find one that was "just right". So I built my own. Check out my artwork of birds being rude at https://rudebirdies.com to see RudeCMS in action. 

Completely flat-file, no databases to corrupt or slow you down. Let me know if you use it and I'll link to your site!

**Features:**
- No database
- No installation beyond copying the files
- Easy customisation
- Infinite Scrolling
- Post Navigation (Previous/Next)
- Slug links for blog posts
- Twitter and Open Graph meta tags
- Automatic site map generation  
  
**Future Updates**
- A better admin interface
- Automatic resizing/converting jpegs to webp
- Anything else I think is cool
