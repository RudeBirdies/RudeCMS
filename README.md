RudeCMS is a content management system (CMS) I built because I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for when building my site https://rudebirdies.com. Check it out to see RudeCMS in action. Completely flat-file, no databases to corrupt or slow you down.

Features:

- No database
- No installation beyond copying the files
- Easy configuration
- 1 Theme
- Infinite Scrolling
- Post Navigation (Previous/Next)
- Slug links for blog posts
